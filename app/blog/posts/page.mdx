## Enhanced Readability and Maintainability

Static typing makes code more readable and maintainable. By explicitly declaring types, developers provide a clear contract of what the code does, making it easier for others (or themselves in the future) to understand and modify the codebase.

## Facilitates Tooling and Refactoring

Modern IDEs leverage static typing to offer advanced features like code completion, refactoring, and static analysis. These tools can automatically detect issues, suggest fixes, and safely refactor code, enhancing developer productivity and reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring.

```csharp
// Refactoring example: Renaming a method in C#
public class Calculator {
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

// After refactoring `Add` to `Sum`, all references are automatically updated.
public class Calculator {
    public int Sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```
